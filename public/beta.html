        <h2>Bacryptup is currently in closed beta</h2>
        <p>
            I'm playing around with affordable hosting, storage and pricing plans. However I understand many would be
            interested in trying out the service as well. <br /><br />
            You can request an access token by specifying your email, and how you plan to use this service. <br /><br />
            Keep in mind, you only need an access token to upload files. Downloading <strong>does not</strong> need an
            access token, just the correct fileID and password. <br /><br />
